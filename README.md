#Caesar Cipher Program
This is a simple C program that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

How the Program Works
The program allows the user to:

Encrypt a text by shifting each letter a certain number of positions (defined by the user).
Decrypt an encrypted text by reversing the shift.
Example:
If the user enters the text hello with a shift of 3, the encrypted result will be khoor. The program also provides the option to decrypt the text back to hello.

Features
Encrypt a given text using Caesar Cipher with a user-defined shift.
Decrypt the text back using the same shift value.
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Handles wrap-around in the alphabet (e.g., 'z' becomes 'a').
